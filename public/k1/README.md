# Kaleidos: CSS Kaleidoscope Effects

A simple kaleidoscope effect produced with a bunch of SASS-powered
CSS rotation and scale transforms.

See it in action here: http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/ or here

**Suddenly, Convenience!** Add it to your browser here:
https://github.com/miketaylr/kaleidos-extension/

## Parameters
You can pass parameters via the query string: e.g.
?n=13&src=http://someurl/someimage.png

* **n** is a positive integer representing the number of "segments" to
create within the kaleidoscope. The provided CSS enthusiastically
supports up to 32 segments but the effect works best with lower
values.

* **src** is a URL for an alternate image.

* Assigning a truthy value to **clean** inhibits the display of the
link to Github.

## Dedication
Dedicated to [@jeanettehayes](http://twitter.com/jeanettehayes), who I
thought might like this kind of thing.

## Minutiae
The name "kaleidos" is derived from the Ancient Greek καλός (kalos),
"beautiful, beauty" and εἶδος (eidos), "that which is seen: form,
shape".

This project is optimised for butterfly wings. A modern browser is
mandatory. Happiness is mandatory.

This might be more accurately described as a
[teleidoscope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleidoscope) but who has
ever heard of such a thing, really.

## TODO
* Some kind of build process like all the cool kids are doing.

## Terms & Conditions

This project is dual licenced under the MIT and GPL licenses because
[that's what Cowboy said to
do](http://benalman.com/news/2010/02/on-licensing-my-code/). I hope
that's okay with everyone.
